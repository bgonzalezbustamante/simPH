\arguments{
\item{obj}{a \code{simspline} class object}

\item{SmoothSpline}{logical whether or not to fit the simulations with
smoothing splines. Creates a smoother plot. See \code{\link{smooth.spline}}
for more information. Note: currently the degrees of freedom are set at 10.}

\item{FacetTime}{a numeric vector of points in time where you would like to
plot Hazard Rates in a facet grid. Only relevant if
\code{qi == 'Hazard Rate'}. Note: the values of Facet Time must exactly
match values of the \code{time} element of \code{obj}.}

\item{xlab}{a label for the plot's x-axis.}

\item{ylab}{a label of the plot's y-axis. The default uses the value of
\code{qi}.}

\item{zlab}{a label for the plot's z-axis. Only relevant if
\code{qi = "Hazard Rate"} and \code{FacetTime == NULL}.}

\item{from}{numeric time to start the plot from. Only relevant if
\code{qi = "Hazard Rate"}.}

\item{to}{numeric time to plot to. Only relevant if
\code{qi = "Hazard Rate"}.}

\item{title}{the plot's main title.}

\item{method}{what type of smoothing method to use to summarize the center
of the simulation distribution.}

\item{lcolour}{character string colour of the smoothing line. The default is
hexadecimal colour \code{lcolour = '#2B8CBE'}. Only relevant if
\code{qi = "Relative Hazard"} or \code{qi = "First Difference"}.}

\item{lsize}{size of the smoothing line. Default is 1. See
\code{\link{ggplot2}}.}

\item{pcolour}{character string colour of the simulated points or ribbons
(when there are not multiple sets of simulations). Default is hexadecimal
colour \code{pcolour = '#A6CEE3'}. Only relevant if
\code{qi = "Relative Hazard"} or \code{qi = "First Difference"} or
\code{qi = "Hazard Rate"} with facets.}

\item{psize}{size of the plotted simulation points. Default is
\code{psize = 1}. See \code{\link{ggplot2}}.}

\item{alpha}{numeric. Alpha (e.g. transparency) for the points, lines, or
ribbons. Default is \code{alpha = 0.2}. See \code{\link{ggplot2}}. Note, if
\code{type = "lines"} or \code{type = "points"} then \code{alpah} sets the
maximum value per line or point at the center of the distribution. Lines or
points further from the center are more transparent the further they get
from the middle.}

\item{surface}{plot surface. Default is \code{surface = TRUE}. Only relevant
if \code{qi == 'Hazard Rate'} and \code{FacetTime = NULL}.}

\item{fit}{one or more of \code{"linear"}, \code{"quadratic"},
\code{"smooth"}, \code{"additive"}; to display fitted surface(s); partial
matching is supported e.g., \code{c("lin", "quad")}. Only relevant if
\code{qi == 'Relative Hazard'} and \code{FacetTime = NULL}.}

\item{type}{character string. Specifies how to plot the simulations. Can be
\code{points}, \code{lines}, or \code{ribbons}. If points then each
simulation value will be plotted. If \code{lines} is chosen then each
simulation is plotted using a different line. Note: any simulation with a
value along its length that is outside of the specified central interval
will be dropped. This is to create a smooth plot. If \code{type = "ribbons"}
a plot will be created with shaded areas ('ribbons') for the minimum and
maximum simulation values (i.e. the middle interval set with \code{qi} in
\code{\link{coxsimSpline}}) as well as the central 50 percent of this area.
It also plots a line for the median value of the full area, so values in
\code{method} are ignored. One of the key advantages of using ribbons
rather than points is that it creates plots with smaller file sizes.}

\item{...}{Additional arguments. (Currently ignored.)}

\value{
a \code{gg} \code{ggplot} class object. See \code{\link{scatter3d}}
for values from \code{scatter3d} calls.
}
\description{
\code{simGG.simspline} uses \link{ggplot2} and \link{scatter3d} to plot
quantities of interest from \code{simspline} objects, including relative
hazards, first differences, hazard ratios, and hazard rates.
}
\details{
Uses \code{ggplot2} and \code{scatter3d} to plot the quantities of
interest from \code{simspline} objects, including relative hazards, first
differences, hazard ratios, and hazard rates. If currently does not support
hazard rates for multiple strata.

It can graph hazard rates as a 3D plot using \code{\link{scatter3d}} with
the dimensions: Time, Hazard Rate, and the value of \code{Xj}. Ribbon plots
are not available with 3D plots. You can also choose to plot hazard rates
for a range of values of \code{Xj} in two dimensional plots at specific
points in time. Each plot is arranged in a facet grid.

Note: A dotted line is created at y = 1 (0 for first difference), i.e. no
effect, for time-varying hazard ratio graphs. No line is created for hazard
rates.
