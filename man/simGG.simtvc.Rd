\usage{
\method{simGG}{simtvc}(obj, from = NULL, to = NULL, xlab = NULL,
  ylab = NULL, title = NULL, smoother = "auto", spalette = "Set1",
  legend = "legend", leg.name = "", lsize = 1, psize = 1, alpha = 0.2,
  type = "points", ...)
}
\arguments{
  \item{obj}{a \code{simtvc} class object}

  \item{from}{numeric time to start the plot from.}

  \item{to}{numeric time to plot to.}

  \item{xlab}{a label for the plot's x-axis.}

  \item{ylab}{a label of the plot's y-axis. The default
  uses the value of \code{qi}.}

  \item{title}{the plot's main title.}

  \item{smoother}{what type of smoothing line to use to
  summarize the center of the simulation distribution.}

  \item{spalette}{colour palette for when there are
  multiple sets of comparisons to plot. Default palette is
  \code{"Set1"}. See \code{\link{scale_colour_brewer}}.}

  \item{legend}{specifies what type of legend to include
  (if applicable). The default is \code{legend = "legend"}.
  To hide the legend use \code{legend = FALSE}. See the
  \code{\link{discrete_scale}} for more details.}

  \item{leg.name}{name of the legend (if applicable).}

  \item{lsize}{size of the smoothing line. Default is 1.
  See \code{\link{ggplot2}}.}

  \item{psize}{size of the plotted simulation points.
  Default is \code{psize = 1}. See \code{\link{ggplot2}}.}

  \item{alpha}{numeric. Alpha (e.g. transparency) for the
  points, lines, or ribbons. Default is \code{alpha = 0.2}.
  See \code{\link{ggplot2}}. Note, if \code{type = "lines"}
  or \code{type = "points"} then \code{alpah} sets the
  maximum value per line or point at the center of the
  distribution. Lines or points further from the center are
  more transparent the further they get from the middle.}

  \item{type}{character string. Specifies how to plot the
  simulations. Can be \code{points}, \code{lines}, or
  \code{ribbons}. If points then each simulation value will
  be plotted. If \code{lines} is chosen then each
  simulation is plotted using a different line. Note: any
  simulation with a value along its length that is outside
  of the specified central interval will be dropped. This
  is to create a smooth plot. If \code{type = "ribbons"} a
  plot will be created with shaded areas ('ribbons') for
  the minimum and maximum simulation values (i.e. the
  middle interval set with \code{qi} in
  \code{\link{coxsimSpline}}) as well as the central 50
  percent of this area. It also plots a line for the median
  value of the full area, so values in \code{smoother} are
  ignored. One of the key advantages of using ribbons
  rather than points is that it creates plots with smaller
  file sizes.}

\description{
\code{simGG.simtvc} uses \link{ggplot2} to plot the
simulated hazards from a \code{simtvc} class object created
by \code{\link{coxsimtvc}} using \link{ggplot2}.
}
\details{
Plots either a time-interactive hazard ratios, first
differences, and relative hazards, or the hazard rates for
multiple strata. Currently the strata legend labels need to
be changed manually (see \code{\link{revalue}} in the
\link{plyr} package) in the \code{simtvc} object with the
\code{strata} component. Also, currently the x-axis tick
marks and break labels must be adjusted manually for
non-linear functions of time. Note: A dotted line is
created at y = 1 (0 for first difference), i.e. no effect,
for time-varying hazard ratio graphs. No line is created
for hazard rates.
