\usage{
  \method{simGG}{siminteract} (obj, from = NULL, to = NULL,
    xlab = NULL, ylab = NULL, title = NULL,
    smoother = "auto", spalette = "Set1", leg.name = "",

    psize = 1, alpha = 0.1, ribbons = FALSE, ...)
}
\arguments{
  \item{obj}{a \code{siminteract} class object}

  \item{xlab}{a label for the plot's x-axis.}

  \item{ylab}{a label of the plot's y-axis. The default
  uses the value of \code{qi}.}

  \item{from}{numeric time to start the plot from. Only
  relevant if \code{qi = "Hazard Rate"}.}

  \item{to}{numeric time to plot to. Only relevant if
  \code{qi = "Hazard Rate"}.}

  \item{title}{the plot's main title.}

  \item{smoother}{what type of smoothing line to use to
  summarize the plotted coefficient.}

  \item{spalette}{colour palette. Not relevant for \code{qi
  = "Marginal Effect"}. Default palette is \code{"Set1"}.
  See \code{\link{scale_colour_brewer}}.}

  \item{leg.name}{name of the stratified hazard rates
  legend. Only relevant if \code{qi = "Hazard Rate"}.}

  \item{lcolour}{character string colour of the smoothing
  line. The default is hexadecimal colour \code{lcolour =
  '#2B8CBE'}. Only relevant if \code{qi = "Marginal
  Effect"}.}

  \item{lsize}{size of the smoothing line. Default is 2.
  See \code{\link{ggplot2}}.}

  \item{pcolour}{character string colour of the simulated
  points. Default is hexadecimal colour \code{pcolour =
  '#A6CEE3'}. Only relevant if \code{qi = "Marginal
  Effect"}.}

  \item{psize}{size of the plotted simulation points.
  Default is \code{psize = 1}. See \code{\link{ggplot2}}.}

  \item{alpha}{point alpha (e.g. transparency) for the
  points or ribbons. Default is \code{alpha = 0.1}. See
  \code{\link{ggplot2}}.}

  \item{ribbons}{logical specifies whether or not to use
  summary ribbons of the simulations rather than plotting
  every simulation value as a point. If \code{ribbons =
  TRUE} a plot will be created with shaded areas
  ('ribbons') for the minimum and maximum simulation values
  (i.e. the middle interval set with \code{qi} in
  \code{\link{coxsimInteract}}) as well as the central 50
  percent of this area. It also plots a line for the median
  value of the full area, so values in \code{smoother} are
  ignored. One of the key advantages of using ribbons
  rather than points is that it creates plots with smaller
  file sizes.}

  \item{...}{Additional arguments. (Currently ignored.)}

\description{
  \code{simGG.siminteract} uses \link{ggplot2} to plot the
  quantities of interest from \code{siminteract} objects,
  including marginal effects, first differences, hazard
  ratios, and hazard rates.
}
\details{
  Uses \link{ggplot2} to plot the quantities of interest
  from \code{siminteract} objects, including marginal
  effects, first differences, hazard ratios, and hazard
  rates. If there are multiple strata, the quantities of
  interest will be plotted in a grid by strata. Note: A
  dotted line is created at y = 1 (0 for first difference),
  i.e. no effect, for time-varying hazard ratio graphs. No
  line is created for hazard rates.

  Note: if \code{qi = "Hazard Ratio"} or \code{qi = "First
  Difference"} then you need to have choosen more than one
  fitted value for \code{X1} in
  \code{\link{coxsimInteract}}.
